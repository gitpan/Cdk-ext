Problems Compiling on Solaris
=============================

Problem: 
	If you are compiling the Cdk extension on a Solaris box against the 
	Solaris curses.h file, then you will notice a conflict in the
	curses.h file. The following message should be displayed when trying
	to compile the Cdk.c file.

"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: invalid type combination
"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: warning: useless declaration
"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: warning: typedef declares no type name
cc: acomp failed for Cdk.c

Solution:
	This is because both Perl and curses.h define a type named bool. Since
	I don't use the curses bool type, you can do one of two things.
	1) Comment out the line 
	typedef       char bool; (should be line 65)
	in curses.h until the compile is done. (Restore it afterwards)
	2) Install Ncurses and compile against that.

	If you comment out the bool, as harsh as that sounds, there are no
	side effects. (I've tried it many times)
