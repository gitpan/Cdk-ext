This file will explain any bugs that I currently know of.

Currently there is one bug related to the callbacks and how they are managed.
I'm not sure if it is the way I have incorporated the callbacks into perl or
a genuine bug in perl. (my money is my implementation). You will see the bug
in action if you run the command interface example in demos/command. Run the
script and press the up arrow 3 times in a row and you should get an error
stating that you are currently out of memory. I haven't had time to really
look into the problem, so if anyone finds it before I do, please mail me
at glover@tuzo.erin.utoronto.ca and give me the details on how to fix it.

Past that I do not know of any bugs. I know you will find them so send them
to me when you find them.

ttfn,
	Mike
